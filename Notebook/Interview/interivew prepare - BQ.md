One time my supervisor needed me to develop a code checking tool from the scratch. I listed what I should do, did some research, and tried every possible solution. Sometimes I needed to ask some co-workers from another team. One of them asked me if I wanted to work with him, maybe because he had a good impression of me. (asked some detailed things) Within a very short period of time, the tool was successfully installed on the pipeline.
