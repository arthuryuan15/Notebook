​	The most challenging part of my previous experience is When I took on a project by ownself, I get a requirement form the my lead about code checking tool. I needed to check some code changed according a specific rules. Somebody did this before, but not successed, so I have no body to learn from. So I list what should I do, and figured out every steps. What I did is searching on Internet, asked some my colleauge who maybe know that, and kept update my process with my lead. I just did those repeatly. about a fews weeks I did it.

I also delivered notifications for different types of courses based on Kafka. 

 In Baidu. 

My primary responsibility is to develop automated test solutions for the systems.  I created a code check tool and deployed it on a test pipeline.  The code check tool will check all submitted code is suitable for the specific rules.  If not, it will send a notification by email.  After developing these tools on the test pipeline, this tool found ten problems in the code in a month.
