# 2  Challenge

One time my supervisor needed me to develop a code checking tool without any support documents. I listed what I should do, did some research, and tried every possible solution. Sometimes I needed to ask some co-workers from another team. One of them asked me if I wanted to work with him, maybe because he had a good impression of me. (asked some detailed things) Within a very short period of time, the tool was successfully installed on the pipeline.	



# 3 work experience

My name is Jinshuai Yuan. I've been working on Baidu and Gaotu as a software developer in China. 

 In GAOTU.  

My primary responsibility is to develop an online teaching platform.  I delivered new features on this platform about homework, including clock-in setting time and reminder tasks, comments and likes etc., which enhanced the 20% user retention rate.  I also delivered notifications for different types of courses based on Kafka. 

 In Baidu. 

My primary responsibility is to develop automated test solutions for the systems.  I created a code check tool and installed it on a test pipeline.  The code check tool will check all submitted code is suitable for the specific rules.  If not, it will send a notification by email.  After developing these tools on the test pipeline, this tool found ten problems in the code in a month.



# 4 asked to describe an experience when I found myself wrong?

I though I can check all the changed file in a commit for code check tools, however the particular rule will effect only a particular files, I didn't need to all files, What need to do is check a few things, that will help me a lot and save my time. 

# 5 How can I contribute to my future team?



# 6 How do you influence people?

deliver result to my lead, that's will be very important, you know what,  I used to have standup meeting every morning. everybody need to describe what's gonna do this day.
