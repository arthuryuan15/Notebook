I needed to check some code changed according a specific rules. Somebody did this before, but not successed, so I have no body to learn from. So I list what should I do, and figured out every steps. What I did is searching on Internet, asked some my colleauge who maybe know that, and kept update my process with my lead. I just did those repeatly. about a fews weeks I did it.
