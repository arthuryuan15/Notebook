Prior to EzBlock, I would ask you to, build a piCar (I'd pay for the car for you)

Get it working on sunfounder python code, Install Java (Segue JDK) on its RaspberryPi Implement Python code with Java code.

If EzBlock makes that Process simpler, that's great.

If not please let me know what your ideas are for the best way to get the piCar up and running with Java.



So far building the car and looking at the code on the RaspberryPi is the only way I currently know how to reverse engineer it

so eventually I want to be able to build the car and have Java running on it

I do have a built car here next to me, just no time to do this myself



an I should create an application which is like Ezblock but can run java?



Method1:

Write java and run in the RaspberryPi,



Method2:

1. How about you look at EzBlock and tell me how close you can come to it.
2.  I'll try to keep it as simple as possible so the project actually gets completed and is usefull.
