1. Extract the physical position in the electronic medical record based on the maximum forward matching algorithm, then use the BIO annotation method to complete the electronic medical record sequence annotation, and then complete the extraction of the entity list based on the semantic rules, and finally put the generated training set into the bidirectional LSTM-CRF. The training of sequence labeling, the corresponding results have been written into a thesis.

2. Through LSTM to complete the trend forecast of server operation and maintenance indicators.

3. Use Python's Networkx module to complete population flow and industry knowledge mapping.

4. Use JavaScript's vis.js module to solve the problem that Geghi can't draw two-way arrows and add custom maps, and display them on the webpage.

5. Use the simulation platform Anylogic to complete the simulation of the medical treatment process and propose to optimize the allocation of medical resources.
