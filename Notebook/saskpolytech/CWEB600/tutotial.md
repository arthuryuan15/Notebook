For tomorrow, we’ll continue with our java code and will do a test of your submission folders. The test will comprise taking a source folder for a java project, zipping it and copying it to your submission directory. Please ensure you’ve checked your access to your directory and if you are still having issues, please let me know so we can get any problems straightened out.
