There are instructions on brightspace for CWEB 600 for downloading data files to be used for the tutorials we go through in class. You will find them under 'Course Information >> Required Resources" .

For today's lecture, I copied the first set into the handouts directory under CWEB600. There is a folder in there called tutorial1. Copy the entire folder to your computer.
