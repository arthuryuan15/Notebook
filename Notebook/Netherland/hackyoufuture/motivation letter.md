# Motivation Letter 

Dear Sir or Madam, 

My name is Yuan Jinshuai and I want to apply Calss 32. 

I have a systematically plan about my study, future career development. Here I would like to give you a comprehensive introduction about my motivation. 

The main reason for me to learn this class is that it’s a short and efficient program that could meet the demands of my current career. It could expand my current knowledge and skills into the fields of technology, computer applications, data communications, data design, and software analysis and design. Currently, I am a software test engineer in Baidu (a famous internet company with market value for over 10 billion Yuan in China). My job includes two parts: one part is to do the software test, the other part is to develop automated test tools and frameworks. Actually my previous education and work experience doesn't match this kind of job what I am doing and I want to work as a data scientist instead of current SEDT(QA) . 

I have finshed projects what I did in Beihang Univeristy(Top 200) with my tutor.Two of them are from State Grid Corporation of China. Which is the research on State Volatility Relationship and Intelligent Analysis Technology of Field Energy Meter, the are more than 800,000 historical failure data of smart meters from more than provinces were analyzed.I used the Drift Brownian Motion Model for fitting smart meters were estimated by EM Algorithm and Least Square Method and possible failure of smart meters were predicted by Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LM Algorithm). However, this result is difficult to understand for people have little computer knowldege and I want to share this result with more people friendly.

So if I learn the knowledge of front-end development, the analysis result will want to show more beautiful and results will put on the personal website so that more people can be seen in the future. If I use my front end development skills, data visualization can be much better.

I want to have a better career prospect, so I need to learn more professional skills in related field. Comparing with those graduates who have professional training backgrounds or overseas study experience, I don’t have much advantages. Therefore, it’s imperative for me to learn this program. If I could complete a front end development  program, it will directly help me to fulfill the tasks in a more efficient way and it could also broaden my career development path in this field. 

Thank you very much for your time. I sincerely hope that you could grant me the visa. If you need any more information please don’t hesitate to contact with me.

 Yours Sincerely,

Yuan Jinshuai
