## WEB DESIGN



## Requirement


make The custom website

**Step 5: The challenge**


The challenge is to create a webpage about something you are ==passionate about.==

It can be about your cat, your favorite band or ==someone you really admire.==

The subject does not matter, we are interested in your coding skills.





It should be a complete page that shows **at least** the following:

- A logical structure of HTML.
- Custom HTML and CSS (frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize are NOT allowed)
- Proper layout of elements. The page should look like a real website.
- Include at least one **navigation bar**, **list**, and a **table**.
- Comments in your code to show us your thought process



**How we will evaluate your assignment:**

We will look at how you’ve implemented the concepts from the course. Most importantly:

\- Do you use classes and id’s correctly?

\- Can you implement a navigation menu that links to different parts of your page?

\- Can you work with different CSS selectors?

\- Can you use the CSS property “float” correctly?

\- Do you include anything extra that you’ve learned outside the KhanAcademy course (e.g. JavaScript, media responsiveness, advanced CSS)?

The more effort the better!
