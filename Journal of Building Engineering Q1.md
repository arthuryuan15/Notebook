1. Only figures of main results in this work were given in the graphical abstract. Brief interpretations should be given.

    主要结果是图的形式，但是缺少解释。

2. As is known to all, the node has a great effect on the mechanical properties of natural bamboo due to the discontinuous distribution of bamboo fibers, thus the creep behaviors of BS from node and internode bamboo should be discussed

    节点的BS行为也得考虑

3. In the Micro-FTIR images, the hemicellulose part should be marked.

    在Micro-FTIR 图中，半纤维素部分也应该标注下。

4. Given the heat treatment condition is only 145 ℃，while the hemicellulose only exhibits a neglectable change at 140 ℃ in Ref 37. Therefore，to prove the decomposition of hemicellulose, the FTIR spectra of natural bamboo and heat-treated bamboo should be provided to show the change of C=O-OH group, and the specific content of hemicellulose should also be measured.

    为了证明半纤维素的分解，需要提供C=O-OH 的变化，和半纤维素的含量的变化

5. Fig. 1, 5, 11, 14, 15, 16 with high resolution should be provided.

    得提供高分辨率的图 1, 5, 11, 14, 15, 16 图不清楚

6. Many defined parameters like the stress ratio, reduction coefficient, relative creep deformation etc. should be listed and explained in a table for a better understanding.

    参数的定义和解释应该单独列个表，这样更好理解一些

7. More logical conclusions should be given.

    结论应该更有逻辑。
